# Installation and setup

I followed the installation as per the [Archlinux wiki article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/rust) - using the upstream installation script:

```bash
curl -f https://sh.rustup.rs > rust.sh
# check it out
vim rust.sh
# make it executable and execute it
chmod +x rust.sh
./rust.sh

```
