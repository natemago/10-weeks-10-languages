Learn 10 programing languages in 10 weeks
=========================================

This repository contains resources, learning materials and example source code for
my journey to learn 10 programing languages in 10 weeks. That gives me one week per
language, so for most of the languages it would be the basic stuff.
Also, I'm putting notes for every language to serve as a quick reference for
the language itself. Because I only have a week, the notes will be pretty basic:
 * How to install and set up the language - install compiler/interpreter (on Linux),
   setup environment ans basic directory structure for a simple project.
 * Links to the language documentation - language syntax, library reference
 * I'll try to learn the basic language features: control structures, parameters matching,
   loops, lambda expressions and other most basic concepts that the language provides.
 * Possibly a links to good tutorial videos on youtube
 * Code examples:
   * For the basic languages features
   * Specific language concepts that I succeed learning in one week
   * Basic I/O - read from stdin, read from file, write to file/stdout
   * Data structures (if applicable for the language)
   * The final "test" - solve 2 randomly chosen puzzles from [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - any year, any level.

I'll put links as I progress, so stay tuned.

# Week 1 - Typescript

Starting off with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). This language is a superset of Javascript.
See more [here](typescript/README.md)

# Week 2 - Julia

From Wikipedia:
> Julia is a high-level general-purpose dynamic programming language that was originally designed to address the needs of high-performance numerical analysis and computational science, without the typical need of separate compilation to be fast, also usable for client and server web use, low-level systems programming or as a specification language.

More, [here](julia/README.md).

# Week 3 - Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
