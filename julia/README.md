Julia
=====

From wikipedia:
> Julia is a high-level general-purpose dynamic programming language that was originally designed to address the needs of high-performance numerical analysis and computational science, without the typical need of separate compilation to be fast, also usable for client and server web use, low-level systems programming or as a specification language.
